# Trello Dashboard

This project is a demo to connect to the Trello API, authenticate and read metadata. The app will show you all list names across your boards and then allow you filter on this. The use case would be to, say, see all lists called _In Progress_ across your projects.

## Getting started

To get the site running, you can follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies

   `npm install`

2. Create a `.env` file in the root and add the following line, replacing with your [Trello App Key](https://trello.com/app-key)

   `TRELLO_KEY=XXX`

3. Run the project

   `npm start`

## Testing

To run the test suites, simply run the following: `npm test`
